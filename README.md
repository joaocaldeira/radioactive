# radioactive

This package is intended for Monte Carlo simulations of physical processes involving radioactive sources and the interaction of the emitted radiation with scatterers and detectors.

The file runit.py provides an example of how to call the functions in the package. The tqdm package is required to run the version with progress bars. A version without that requirement is also available in the radioactive_nobars.py file.

See the pdf file for additional documentation.
